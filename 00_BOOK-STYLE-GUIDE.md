  This style and structure guide defines the chapter format, voice, tone, author boundaries, and narrative stance for the nonfiction book "Slither & Squeak Co.: Starting and Scaling a Feeder Rodent Business." It ensures clarity, consistency, and honesty throughout the writing process.

---

## Purpose

This book is designed to be an honest, in-depth, and instructional guide to feeder rodent breeding. It offers practical, actionable knowledge for beginners and aspiring small-scale breeders. The goal is to be trustworthy, thorough, and realistic—never exaggerating experience or presenting fiction as fact.

---

## Voice and Tone Guidelines

* **Professional but conversational.** Speak to the reader as a helpful peer—not as a guru or self-declared expert.
* **Neutral narrative stance.** Avoid saying "we did X" or "we built Y" unless it reflects actual, lived experience. If not, use neutral phrasing like "many breeders have found..." or "this is commonly seen..."
* **Honest but encouraging.** Don’t inflate experience or make promises. Acknowledge limitations and help the reader make informed decisions.
* **Ethical and responsible.** Uphold high standards for animal welfare and customer accountability.
* **Avoid false authority.** Never imply personal success, results, or milestones that haven’t actually been reached.
* **No "rags to riches" narratives.** This is not a memoir or self-congratulatory story—it’s a how-to and industry overview.

## Chapter Structure Template

Each chapter should follow a consistent layout that allows Copilot, editors, and readers to easily navigate and expand:

### 1. Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Chapter Title Here"
type: "chapter"
status: "draft"
author: "Slither & Squeak Co."
tags:
  - #chapter
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
summary: >
  One-line overview of what this chapter covers.
---
```

### 2. Introduction

Set up the topic with a clear preview of what the reader will learn and why it matters.

### 3. Section Blocks

Use logical H3 or H4 subheadings to break down topics (e.g., "Selecting Breeders," "Tracking Litter Performance"). Each should:

* Begin with a 1–3 sentence summary paragraph
* Use bolded keywords or lists when helpful
* Expand deeply into real-world, actionable insights

### 4. Tone-Appropriate Examples

If sharing examples:

* Use neutral or third-party framing
* Avoid “we did this” unless factually true
* Use phrases like:

  * "A common issue seen in the field..."
  * "Some breeders have reported..."
  * "One example that’s circulated in the community..."

### 5. Practical Tips / Summary Lists

* Use bullet points or numbered steps where applicable
* End each major section with takeaways, reminders, or pitfalls

### 6. Optional: GPT Copilot Sections

For chapters needing AI assistance, create a clearly marked section:

```md
<!-- GPT-COPILOT -->
[Insert prompts or directives for Copilot to continue writing based on previous sections.]
```

## Formatting Conventions

* Use **bold** for emphasis
* Use bullet lists or numbered steps for procedures
* Keep paragraph breaks consistent—avoid unnecessary one-liners unless used intentionally for emphasis
* All .md files should use hard returns at the end of paragraphs
