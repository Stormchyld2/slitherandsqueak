# Chapter 8: Weaning and Growth for Maximum Output

---

## 🎯 Chapter Goals

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- **Stage and sort weaned rodents by size:** Match output to buyer demand and optimize bin management.
- **Monitor weight and development:** Use data to ensure consistent, healthy growth and spot issues early.
- **Match feeder size categories to market needs:** Understand timing and best practices for each size tier.
- **Optimize euthanasia timing:** Maximize quality and minimize waste for every feeder size.
- **Maintain healthy grow-out bins:** Prevent overcrowding, stress, and disease during the critical growth phase.

## 📘 What You’ll Learn in This Chapter

You’ll learn how to transition pups from mother’s milk to solid food, monitor their development, and group them for optimal growth and marketability. We’ll cover practical strategies for weighing, sorting, and tracking animals, as well as tips for keeping grow-out bins clean, healthy, and efficient. By the end, you’ll be able to maximize both output and animal welfare.

## 🏠 Overview

Weaning is a turning point in every rodent’s life—and in your operation’s productivity. Done well, it sets the stage for rapid, healthy growth and high survival rates. Done poorly, it leads to stunted animals, disease, and wasted effort. This chapter will guide you through the best practices for weaning, sorting, and growing out your animals, with a focus on efficiency, health, and meeting buyer expectations.

## 🐹 Real-World Examples

One breeder weans too early, resulting in weak, undersized animals and high losses. Another waits for clear signs of readiness, sorts by size, and tracks growth weekly. Their animals are robust, and their operation is known for consistent, high-quality feeders. We’ll break down the steps that make the difference.

## 💡 Author Reflection

I used to rush weaning, thinking faster meant more production. But I learned that patience, careful sorting, and close monitoring led to healthier animals and happier customers. Now, my grow-out bins are cleaner, my losses are lower, and my feeders are in demand. The details matter—don’t cut corners.
