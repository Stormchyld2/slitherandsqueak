# CO₂ Euthanasia SOP – Feeder Rodents

## Purpose
To ensure the humane, consistent, and safe euthanasia of rodents intended for use as frozen feeders using carbon dioxide (CO₂). This SOP is designed to reduce animal suffering, protect handler safety, and comply with ethical standards.

---

## Equipment & Materials
- CO₂ source: Food-grade compressed gas cylinder with regulator (NOT dry ice)
- Euthanasia chamber with sealable lid (preferably transparent)
- Tubing to connect cylinder to chamber
- Scale (optional, for dosing or batch control)
- PPE (gloves, goggles, mask for prolonged exposure)
- Cooler or freezer for post-euthanasia storage
- Labeling supplies (date, weight, ID tags)

---

## Procedure

### 1. **Preparation**
- Inspect all equipment for leaks or damage.
- Verify CO₂ supply is adequate and the regulator is functioning.
- Ensure the chamber is clean and dry.
- Only euthanize healthy animals designated for feeder use. Sick or injured rodents should be humanely euthanized separately, as needed.

---

### 2. **Loading the Chamber**
- Place rodents in the euthanasia chamber.
- Avoid overcrowding — animals should be able to lie flat and not pile.
  - **Rats**: 3–5 small/medium per cycle; fewer if jumbo.
  - **Mice**: 5–10 per cycle depending on size.
- Close the chamber securely before introducing gas.

---

### 3. **CO₂ Introduction**
- Begin **slow-fill** process:
  - Open the regulator to allow a gradual fill rate of **10–30% of chamber volume per minute**.
  - Do NOT flood the chamber quickly — this causes distress and pain.
- Observe rodents carefully:
  - Animals will become unconscious in 30–90 seconds.
  - Death typically occurs within 5–7 minutes.

---

### 4. **Confirmation of Death**
- After at least **1 minute** post-last movement, confirm death by:
  - No breathing
  - No heartbeat (check visually or by gentle palpation if needed)
  - No corneal reflex (touch eye gently—no blink = confirmed)
- Keep lid sealed an additional **1–2 minutes** after final movement.

---

### 5. **Post-Euthanasia Handling**
- Remove animals and place directly into labeled freezer bags or containers.
- Mark packaging with:
  - Date
  - Quantity
  - Size (e.g., pinky, weanling, adult)
- Freeze immediately to preserve quality.
- Clean chamber between uses with appropriate disinfectant.

---

## Safety Notes
- NEVER inhale CO₂ directly.
- DO NOT use makeshift or unregulated sources (like dry ice or vinegar-baking soda reactions).
- CO₂ euthanasia should be performed in a **well-ventilated area**.
- If any rodent shows signs of recovery or irregular breathing after removal, **immediately return to chamber and repeat process**.

---

## Record Keeping
Maintain a log of:
- Date
- Number euthanized
- Batch identifiers (if applicable)
- Notes on equipment function or animal behavior (if unusual)
