# 🐍📚 Slither & Squeak Nonfiction Book Project

Welcome to the official writing repository for:

## 🧱 How to Start a New Chapter

1. Duplicate `chapter-template.md`
2. Rename and place inside `chapters/` (e.g., `04_environment.md`)
3. Fill out the frontmatter
4. Replace placeholder content and write using the section structure

Use inline prompts to guide Copilot:

```markdown
<!-- Copilot: Write an example about how a breeder prices bulk feeders -->
```

---

## ✍️ Writing Best Practices

* Keep sections short and skimmable
* Use bullet lists, numbered steps, and tables
* Include real-world examples or case studies
* Use clear headers: `## 🚀 Chapter Goals`, `## 🔁 Recap`, etc.
* Write for reptile keepers, breeders, and small business readers

---

## 🧰 Publishing Tips

This project is designed for easy export using tools like:

* **Pandoc** (to generate PDF or DOCX)
* **Amazon KDP** (Kindle + Print)
* **Markdown-based CMS or blog**

The consistent frontmatter and markdown style will help generate clean outputs later.
