# 🧠 How to Use Templates in the Slither & Squeak Nonfiction Writing System

## 📁 Project Folder Structure

Your VS Code project should look like this:

```
slither-and-squeak-book/
├── README.md
├── book.md (optional full compiled file)
├── chapters/
│   ├── 01_introduction.md
│   ├── 02_feeder-industry.md
│   └── ...
├── templates/
│   └── chapter-template.md
├── assets/
│   └── images/
├── metadata/
│   └── frontmatter.yaml
```

Each `chapters/` file should be a standalone markdown file using the template from `chapter-template.md`.

---

## 🧩 The Chapter Template: What It Does

The `chapter-template.md` file is a complete, professional-grade nonfiction chapter scaffold designed to:

* Structure your writing into clear, skimmable parts
* Give GitHub Copilot predictable patterns to complete
* Make future formatting for Kindle, print, or PDF easier
* Improve readability and reader retention

---

## 🧾 What’s in the Template?

### ✅ YAML Frontmatter

Every chapter starts with:

```yaml
---
title: "Chapter 1: Example"
type: "book-chapter"
status: "draft"
author: "Slither & Squeak Co."
tags:
  - #tag1
created: 2025-07-21
updated: 2025-07-21
summary: >
  One-sentence description of this chapter.
---
```

This enables markdown processors (like Pandoc) and Copilot to understand the context of the file.

---

### 💬 Copilot Prompt Comment

Place this comment below the frontmatter:

```markdown
<!--
Copilot Prompt:
You are helping write a nonfiction instructional business book. Each chapter includes frontmatter, structured sections, examples, and tools. Write clearly and helpfully.
-->
```

This primes GitHub Copilot to write in the correct style, tone, and structure.

---

## 🧱 How to Create a New Chapter

1. Copy `templates/chapter-template.md`
2. Rename it to something like `03_rodent-biology.md` inside `chapters/`
3. Update the title and summary
4. Begin writing!

---

## ✨ Optional: Copilot-Boosting Comments

Anywhere in your markdown, you can guide Copilot:

```markdown
<!-- Copilot: Expand on how to price frozen feeders in bulk -->
```

or:

```markdown
<!-- Copilot: Add 3 mistakes beginner breeders make here -->
```

Use comments like these often to make Copilot write smarter and more targeted content.

---

## ✅ Writing Tips for Using the Template

* Always write in sections (`##`, `###`)
* Use bullet lists or tables where possible
* Keep paragraphs short and purposeful
* Add a call-to-action at the end of each chapter
* Think like a course builder: what’s the outcome for the reader?

---

## 🧰 Example Section Headings

```markdown
## 🚀 Chapter Goals
## 🔍 In This Chapter You’ll Learn
## 1. [Section Title]
## 2. [Section Title]
## 3. Common Mistakes
## 🧪 Case Study
## 🛠️ Tools or Worksheets
## 🔁 Recap & Action Steps
## 💬 Author Insight
```

Stick to these or a variation of them for best results.

---

## 📚 Using the Template with Pandoc or Kindle Later

This formatting is designed to convert beautifully to:

* PDF print layouts
* Kindle eBooks
* Print-on-demand books via Amazon KDP

We'll handle compilation later. For now, **just stay consistent**.

---

## 💬 Questions?

If you're ever stuck, just:

* Copy from the last working chapter
* Ask Copilot directly: “Write this next section based on the last one.”
* Use the prompts already in your template

You're building not just a book—but a system you can use again and again.
